        <Heading tag="h2" class="mt-6 mb-2">Information We Collect</Heading>
        <P class="mb-4">
            We may collect various pieces of information from you, including but
            not limited to: thoughts you had while waiting for the page to load,
            the number of sighs you emit while using our interface, and your
            favorite species of fish. We also track how many times you clicked
            that button even though we told you not to.
        </P>

        <Heading tag="h2" class="mt-6 mb-2">How We Use Your Information</Heading
        >
        <P class="mb-4">
            Your information might be used for several important purposes, such
            as: determining which underwater creature matches your personality
            type, improving our ever-growing collection of fish puns, and
            sometimes just staring at it in confusion wondering why we collected
            it in the first place.
        </P>

        <Heading tag="h2" class="mt-6 mb-2">Data Storage</Heading>
        <P class="mb-4">
            All user data is stored using cutting-edge technology, which may
            include: an old shoebox under someone's desk, post-it notes stuck to
            the office refrigerator, or occasionally encrypted in our
            state-of-the-art database (which is a text file named "<a
                href="/database.txt"
                class="hover:underline">database.txt</a
            >"). We promise to keep your data for exactly as long as we remember
            it exists.
        </P>

        <Heading tag="h2" class="mt-6 mb-2">Third-Party Sharing</Heading>
        <P class="mb-4">
            We may share your information with third parties including, but not
            limited to: the office goldfish who needs something new to look at,
            any random person who asks nicely, and occasionally, by accident,
            when our developer forgets to close a debugging window. Rest assured
            that all third parties are held to the same rigorous standards of
            casualness that we uphold.
        </P>

        <Heading tag="h2" class="mt-6 mb-2">Cookies Policy</Heading>
        <P class="mb-4">
            We use cookies on this site. Not the tracking kind, the chocolate
            chip kind. Unfortunately, they're digital so you can't eat them.
            We're still trying to figure out what they do, but everyone else has
            them, so we wanted them too.
        </P>

        <Heading tag="h2" class="mt-6 mb-2">Your Rights</Heading>
        <P class="mb-4">
            You have several rights regarding your data, including the right to
            be forgotten (which happens automatically as we rarely remember user
            data anyway), the right to access your information (good luck, we're
            not sure where we put it), and the right to correction (please use
            crayon for any edits, it's easier to see).
        </P>

        <Heading tag="h2" class="mt-6 mb-2">Changes to This Policy</Heading>
        <P class="mb-4">
            This policy may change whenever we feel like it, when Mercury is in
            retrograde, or when our legal team (a Magic 8-Ball) advises us to
            update it. We won't notify you of changes because, let's be honest,
            you weren't going to read it anyway.
        </P>
