                        Ichthyological consultation was procured during the
                        formulation of these pseudo-legal instruments, a
                        methodological approach which, upon comprehensive
                        multi-factorial analysis, may be deemed advantageous
                        vis-Ã -vis the counterfactual scenario wherein such
                        consultation was not obtained.
